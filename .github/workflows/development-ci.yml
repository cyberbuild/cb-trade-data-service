      # 2. Set up Conda environment
      # This step should install all dependencies from environment.yml,
      # including conda packages and those listed under the 'pip:' section.
      # Ensure your environment.yml has 'name: cb-trade', 'python=3.9',
      # 'pip' as a conda dependency, and then ccxt, flake8, black, etc., under the 'pip:' section.
      - name: Set up Conda environment

          use-mamba: true # Use Mamba for faster and potentially more robust dependency resolution

      # 3. Install/Verify build tools (if not already in environment.yml)
      # Best practice: include build, pytest, wheel in environment.yml dependencies (conda or pip section).
      # This step now primarily serves as a check or installs if truly missing.

      # 4. (Optional but Recommended) Lint and Format Check
      # Flake8 and Black should be installed from environment.yml's pip section by Step 2.
      # Flake8 will use the .flake8 configuration file in the project root if present,
      # or the command-line options. Here we explicitly exclude the 'tests' folder.

      # 5. Run tests
      # Pytest should be installed from environment.yml (conda or pip section) by Step 2.

      # and direct assignment for non-sensitive configurations.
